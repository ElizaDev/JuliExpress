# UPDATE

I am currently too busy to update this. Feel free to use it, but it might not work.

# JuliExpress

Juli is a bot used to relay chat between Twitch and Discord and play music. The bot is still very new and undeveloped. Expect many changes and features to come. Please follow my Trello board for upcoming features and progress.

# Requirements

You'll need to use Node.js(https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm) to run this. Make sure this is installed first. Then move on to the next steps.

This bot is dependant upon tmi.js(https://docs.tmijs.org/), discord.js(https://discord.js.org) and discord.js-music-v11(https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js-music-v11). You will need to install these and their dependencies in order to get it up and running.
